# Daimon Slayers

The file "sha-256-hash.txt" contains a SHA-256 hash of a JSON file that contains
all of our NFT's metadata. After we reach 100% sold out, we will upload this file
so that you can create a hash of it yourselves (using a service like http://onlinemd5.com/)
and compare it with the hash in this file.

We are doing this to prove that we will not change the metadata. If the hashes do not match,
it means something in the file has changed. If they are the same, it means that the file did
not change from the point the hash in this file was made.

We were inspired by The Sevens NFT project for doing this, so all credit goes to them
for thinking of this idea to prove that we do not tamper with the metadata after launch.
